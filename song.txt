Tonight I wanna give it all to you
In the darkness
There's so much I wanna do
And tonight I wanna lay it at your feet

I was made for lovin' you baby
You were made for lovin' me.
And I can't get enough of you baby

There's something that drives me wild
And tonight we're gonna make it all come true
'Cause girl, you were made for me
And girl I was made for you

And girl I was made for you
